# ps-LSTM

This repository contains two jupyter notebooks showing how we sample subset from constraint-free LSTM in a biased manner via path sampling. The subset can then be used to re-train new LSTMs to obtain a LSTM model with constrained thermodynamic or dynamic constraints. In this repository we also include the 200$ns$ trajectory of $\chi$ from Aib9 MD simulation used in the paper.
